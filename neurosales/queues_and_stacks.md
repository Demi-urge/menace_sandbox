1) Queues and stacks: The queue will maintain the last 3â€“6 messages max, focusing on recent triggers and objections. Stack memory will track CTA micro-chains (e.g., message > reply > escalation). Memory will be non-personal, with time-decay removing old context quickly. Used for managing tone shifts and pattern reversals (e.g., changing emotional approach when resistance is detected).
