# Changelog

## Unreleased
- Decommissioned the visual-agent pathway; all workflows now run exclusively through the SelfCodingEngine.
- Removed obsolete OCR configuration hooks from `BotDevConfig`.
- Documented the Windows sandbox launcher GUI workflow and logging behaviour.
- Ensured the dynamic path router remains available during lazy imports so configuration files resolve regardless of the working directory.
