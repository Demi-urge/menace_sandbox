# Database Router

The `DBRouter` routes SQLite queries to either a local database specific to a
Menace instance or to a shared database used by all instances.

## Instantiation

Initialise a router via `init_db_router(menace_id)` or directly by creating a
`DBRouter(menace_id, local_db_path, shared_db_path)`. Local databases are stored
at `./menace_<menace_id>_local.db` and shared data lives in `./shared/global.db`
by default. `init_db_router` also stores the router in `GLOBAL_ROUTER` for
modules that rely on a globally accessible instance.

## Shared vs. local tables

Tables listed in `SHARED_TABLES` are written to the shared database while
`LOCAL_TABLES` entries reside in the local database. Table names must be
explicitly declared; unlisted tables raise a `ValueError` to keep routing
explicit. The default configuration assigns:

**Shared tables**

- `enhancements`
- `bots`
- `errors`
- `code`
- `discrepancies`
- `workflow_summaries`

**Local tables**

- `models`
- `patch_history`
- `variants`
- `memory`
- `events`
- `sandbox_metrics`
- `roi_logs`
- `menace_config`

Update these sets to route additional tables:

```python
from db_router import SHARED_TABLES, LOCAL_TABLES

SHARED_TABLES.add("alerts")
LOCAL_TABLES.add("session")
```

The router can also be configured via environment variables or a JSON file. Set
`DB_ROUTER_SHARED_TABLES`, `DB_ROUTER_LOCAL_TABLES` or `DB_ROUTER_DENY_TABLES`
to comma separated table lists. Alternatively, point `DB_ROUTER_CONFIG` to a
JSON file containing `{"shared": [...], "local": [...], "deny": [...]}` to
extend or restrict the built-in lists.

## Retrieving connections

Use `DBRouter.get_connection(table_name)` to obtain an `sqlite3.Connection` for
a given table. The router returns the shared connection for names in
`SHARED_TABLES` and the local connection for `LOCAL_TABLES` entries:

```python
from db_router import init_db_router

router = init_db_router("alpha")
conn = router.get_connection("bots")
cursor = conn.execute("SELECT * FROM bots")
```

## Replacing direct `sqlite3.connect` calls

Modules should avoid calling `sqlite3.connect()` directly. Instead, retrieve a
connection through the router so table placement remains centralised:

```python
# Legacy code
conn = sqlite3.connect("bots.db")

# Updated approach
from db_router import GLOBAL_ROUTER, init_db_router

router = GLOBAL_ROUTER or init_db_router("alpha")
conn = router.get_connection("bots")
```

This pattern ensures shared data resides in the global database while
instance-specific tables use the local database.

## Thread safety

Connections are created with `check_same_thread=False` and guarded by
`threading.Lock` instances so multiple threads can safely interact with the
router.

## Logging

`DBRouter` accepts an optional `logger` and `log_level`. Each invocation of
`get_connection()` records the table name and whether a shared or local
connection was returned. Set `log_level=None` or raise the logger's level to
silence these messages in production environments.

## Tableâ€‘sharing policy

- **Shared tables**: `SHARED_TABLES` entries persist across different
  `menace_id` instances. Writes to these tables are visible to all routers
  pointing at the same shared database.
- **Local tables**: `LOCAL_TABLES` entries are stored in each instance's local
  database, keeping data isolated between different `menace_id` values. Table
  names outside these sets are rejected.
