# Vector Service API (deprecated)

`vector_service` has been merged into the canonical `semantic_service`
package. Use `semantic_service` for `Retriever`, `ContextBuilder`,
`PatchLogger` and `EmbeddingBackfill`. This document is kept for
backwards reference; see [semantic_service.md](semantic_service.md) for
up-to-date usage examples.
