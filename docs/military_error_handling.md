# Military Grade Error Handling

`advanced_error_management.py` introduces helpers that push Menace error management toward a 10/10 score.

- **FormalVerifier** runs `flake8`, `bandit`, `mypy` and Hypothesis-based tests against patched code. When `angr` is available it also performs a symbolic analysis and fails verification if new execution paths raise exceptions.
- **TelemetryReplicator** streams error telemetry to Kafka, Sentry and local disk.
  Events include integrity hashes and fall back to disk if brokers are unavailable.
- **AutomatedRollbackManager** rolls back patches across multiple nodes automatically.
- **AnomalyEnsembleDetector** flags unusual metrics using multiple heuristics.
- **SelfHealingOrchestrator** restarts bots that stop sending heartbeats using
  Docker, Kubernetes or VM backends. `probe_and_heal()` performs health checks
  via HTTP before triggering a restart, which is logged in the `KnowledgeGraph`.
- **SecureLog** signs log lines with Ed25519. The `export()` helper verifies all
  signatures and produces a copy for external auditors.
- **PlaybookGenerator** writes JSON runbooks based on detected issues.
- **PredictiveResourceAllocator** adjusts resources before bottlenecks occur.

These tools complement the existing ErrorBot and Watchdog pipeline for near-military grade reliability.

## SecureLog Usage

````python
from pathlib import Path
from menace.meta_logging import SecureLog

log = SecureLog(Path("ops.log"))
log.append("system started")

# verify signatures and export the plain log
log.export(Path("auditable_ops.log"))
````

`export()` raises `RuntimeError` if any stored signature fails verification.
