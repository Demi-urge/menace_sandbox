"""Lightweight bootstrap hook for the optional quick-fix background worker.

The production environment runs a dedicated service that continuously monitors
error reports and invokes :mod:`quick_fix_engine` to suggest corrective patches.
For local development and CI the full dependency chain is often unavailable,
causing the sandbox bootstrapper to warn that the service is missing.  The
helper in this repository keeps the bootstrap workflow quiet by providing a
minimal shim that can be safely imported in constrained environments.

The module purposely avoids importing heavy quick-fix dependencies at import
time.  When :func:`start` is invoked we attempt to import the real
:mod:`quick_fix_engine` package.  If the import succeeds a short log message is
emitted to confirm that the real service should be started separately.  When the
module is unavailable a debug log explains that the background worker is
skipped.  In either case the bootstrapper considers the optional service
"installed" which prevents noisy warnings during ``manual_bootstrap`` runs.

    the bootstrap process.  The function is idempotent and simply records that
    the service has been "started" to avoid duplicate log messages.
